## 0.63.5 - 2021-03-10

Fix & change Android PlatformColor binding to use built-in selector [#737](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/pull/737) by [@diaozheng999](https://github.com/diaozheng999)

- Fixed `PlatformColor.Android.getAttr`: now use `"?android:attr/*` instead of `"?attr/*`
- Added `PlatformColor.Android.get{x}` (x being an integer from 2 to 7) so you can use `@android:color` & `@?android:attr` in the same call, as `PlatformColor` accepts multiple arguments as fallbacks.
- Added `PlatformColor.unsafeGet{x}` (x being an integer from 2 to 7) that allow you to pass unsafe values (string, which can be useful for user defined values).

Also:

- Added `PlatformColor.Android.get`
- Added `PlatformColor.Ios.get{x}` like Android
- `PlatformColor.IOS` is deprecated in favor of `PlatformColor.Ios`
- `PlatformColor.Android.unsafeGet` is deprecated in favor of `PlatformColor.unsafeGet`

## 0.63.4 - 2021-02-24

Fixed `measure` & `measureInWindow` functions types [#736](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/pull/736) by [@Freddy03h](https://github.com/Freddy03h)

## 0.63.3 - 2021-02-19

Added Pressable with child function and interaction states (as `Pressable_`) [#735](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/pull/735) by [@Freddy03h](https://github.com/Freddy03h)

## 0.63.2 - 2020-11-20

Breaking change, sorry: Reverting ActivityIndicator size as polymorphic variant so we can keep the exact option.

## 0.63.1 - 2020-11-17

Fix npm description

## 0.63.0 - 2020-11-06

### Breaking changes

- ⚠️ Changed minimal versions required [#722](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/pull/722) by [@cknitt](https://github.com/cknitt)
  - ReScript / bs-platform 8.2
  - reason-react 0.9.1
- Switched solution to avoid warnings being throw as errors [b5038e9](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/commit/b5038e9) by [@MoOx](https://github.com/MoOx) with the help of [@Freddy03h](https://github.com/Freddy03h) and [@bobzhang](https://github.com/bobzhang) in [#718](https://github.com/reason-react-native/safe-area-context/pull/4)
  This will help to avoid issue if ReScript introduce new warning that caused in the past impossibility to use our bindings (eg: ReScript 8.2 bs.string annontations).
- Switch to polymorphic variants instead of abstract types where possible
  [#724](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/pull/724) [#727](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/pull/727) by [@cknitt](https://github.com/cknitt)
- Removed superfluous bs.string attributes [#723](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/pull/723) by [@cknitt](https://github.com/cknitt)
  This change shouldn't impact your code if you are using ReScript 8.2 as required.
- Accessibility changes for react-native 0.63 [#728](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/pull/728) by [@cknitt](https://github.com/cknitt)
  - Removed `accessibilityComponentType`
  - Removed `accessibilityTraits`.
  - Added `AccessibilityActionEvent`
  - Added `onAccessibilityAction`.
  - Added `Accessibility.actionInfo` (already there, but broken - missing unit to terminate argument list).
  - Note that `Accessibility.role` was actually already up to date (except for the value "switch" which we can't add because it's a keyword). Feel free to open an issue if you need `switch` value.
- Removed `Global.unstable_enableLogBox` [#718](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/pull/718) by [@gedeagas](https://github.com/gedeagas)
  This is now enabled by default in React Native 0.63. See added `LogBox` bindings for more options.
- Removed `tintColor` prop from Switch component [#714](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/pull/714) by [@gedeagas](https://github.com/gedeagas)

### Fixes

- Fixed `VirtualizedListMethods.scrollToItemParams` [#715](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/pull/715) by [@cknitt](https://github.com/cknitt)

### New Features

- Added `DynamicColorIOS` [#717](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/pull/717) by [@celsobonutti](https://github.com/celsobonutti)
  Note that there is only 2 keys (`light` and `dark`) but React Native documentation mention they might be more in the future, without saying if they will be mandatory or not. If you want to protect yourself, you might want to make your own factory. In any case, we can still deprecate the `make` binding & create a new external binding with optional keys. So don't worry too much.
- Added `PlatformColor` binding [#730](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/pull/730) by [@rifaldhiaw](https://github.com/rifaldhiaw)
- Added `PermissionsAndroid.accessBackgroundLocation` [#729](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/pull/729) by [@cknitt](https://github.com/cknitt) + [b8392e3](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/commit/b8392e3) by [@MoOx](https://github.com/MoOx)
- Added `LogBox` [#711](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/pull/711) by [@idkjs](https://github.com/idkjs)
- Added `accessibilityActions` prop [#713](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/pull/713) by [@gedeagas](https://github.com/gedeagas)
- Added `Pressable` [#712](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/pull/712) by [@gedeagas](https://github.com/gedeagas)
- Added `AppState` values `unknown` and `extension` (iOS) [#726](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/pull/726) by [@cknitt](https://github.com/cknitt)

### Misc

- ReScript branding has been adopted in various places in all the repos of our organisation.
- More futur proof "files" patterns for npm (in case of interop files) [1a3b677](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/commit/1a3b677) by [@MoOx](https://github.com/MoOx)
- Simplify package.json files section [a9cacbd](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/commit/a9cacbd) by [@MoOx](https://github.com/MoOx)

## 0.62.3 - 2020-08-07

- Stop blocking compilation because of ReScript warnings (emitted as errors) [#708](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/pull/708) by [@jfrolich](https://github.com/jfrolich)  
  This is to ensure ReScript 8.2 compatibility & avoid similar problem in the future.

## 0.62.2 - 2020-07-27

- Fixed ScrollEvent type [5df7fb0](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/commit/5df7fb0ff5f7c1be2373347bc2ca1923e69ba112) by [@MoOx](https://github.com/MoOx)

## 0.62.1 - 2020-07-27

- Fixed View props for all components that use them (stay in sync) [e5adee0](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/commit/e5adee0a71fa189937d64b130fd45d0deac0b4e8) by [@MoOx](https://github.com/MoOx)
- Removed TabBarIOS (removed since RN 0.59) [13991e0](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/commit/13991e0f39cf04c9e0390e6bad3db759ac466e65) by [@MoOx](https://github.com/MoOx)
- Internal: removed duplicated code source in md files (website will produce the same result - no manual syncing required) [1524b87](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/commit/1524b87b077e9920a85786bd5e3f887991a7c723) by [@MoOx](https://github.com/MoOx)

## 0.62.0 - 2020-07-20

The release we all have been waiting for (thanks for you patience)!  
Huge thanks to [@sgny](https://github.com/sgny) which handled most of the
changes directly related to react-native 0.62.

**tl;dr**: this release includes

- breaking changes related to `reason-react@0.8`
- breaking changes related to `bs-platform@7` (say bye to most `##` accessors in
  favor of `.`)
- breaking changes related to `react-native@0.62` (say bye to removed
  components)

So in order to upgrade to this release you need to upgrade all this dependencies
at the same time. Be sure to respect
[`peerDependencies`](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native/blob/0.62.0/package.json#L4)
before reporting issue.
